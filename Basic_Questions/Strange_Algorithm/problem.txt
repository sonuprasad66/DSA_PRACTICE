===> Strange Algorithm Ended

---> Description

Sam is very creative and wants to make an algorithm of his own. The algorithm works like this:

If input n is divisible by two the algorithm divides it by two, else, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one and repeats this till n becomes 1.

Now it is your turn to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n.

Read the sample input for better understanding.


Input
Input Format

The only input line contains an integer n

Constraints

1 <= n <= 10^6

Output
Print a line that contains all values ofnduring the algorithm.


Sample Input 1 
3

Sample Output 1

3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

Hint

Sample Input 1 Explanation

For example, the sequence for n = 3as follows:


3→10→5→16→8→4→2→1
