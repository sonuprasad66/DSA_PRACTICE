Array Parts of Four 
Description

You are given an array stored in a variable with the namearr

The size of the array is stored in a variable with the nameN

The value stored inNis always divisible by 4

You have to find the value of the equation -2*c1 + c2 + 2*c3 + c4, such that

The array is divided into 4 halves

c1 -> The sum of the first half of the array

c2 -> The sum of the second half of the array

c3 -> The sum of third half of the array

c4 -> The sum of the fourth half of the array
For example, consider the value stored inN = 8, andarr = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]

Now,c1 = 1 + 2 = 3,c2 = 3 + 4 = 7,c3 = 5 + 6 = 11,c4 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the value of the equation2*(3) + 7 + 2*(11) + 15 = 6 + 7 + 22 + 15 = 50, which is the required output


Input
The first line of the input contains the value stored inN

The next line contains the value stored inarr


Output
Print the value of the equation as explained in the problem statement

Sample Input 1 

8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Sample Output 1

50
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored inN = 8, andarr = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]

Now,c1 = 1 + 2 = 3,c2 = 3 + 4 = 7,c3 = 5 + 6 = 11,c4 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the value of the equation2*(3) + 7 + 2*(11) + 15 = 6 + 7 + 22 + 15 = 50
